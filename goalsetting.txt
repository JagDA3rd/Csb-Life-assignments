GOAL SETTING

1) reflect on past experiences: 
	a) strengths :  -Can learn things easily when I can concentrate
 			-Being able to adapt to any gaming genres in a few minutes

			-Because of severe asthma, not good at sports
			-Constant fear of going out in Manila because of muggers, kidnappers, killes, etc.

	c) role models: -Chuck Norris: Because his fists makes the speed of light wish that it's faster
			-Ferdinand Marcos: True leader but was toppled by the propaganda of the oligarchs and the Aquina admin *cough*Cojuanco*cough*
			-Carl Marx: Feared by greedy capitalist because of righteous rule and spending philosophy for the people and state and disbanding 
				    the government system to one equal ruling system for all.
