"I adore in all things the will of God in my Regard" 
-	St benilde

 Before he died or left this world. St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle Loved all things god made for him in the end. This makes me realize everything in this world not only has a purpose but has a connection to every person's living. It might be a sign to alert you what god is trying to tell you. He can/has the power to communicate to you in your dreams. Every person has a heart for all things on earth all that is given was for man and the animals. All what nature has to give was created by God to be used by all earthly inhabitants. 
	I view this as inspirational because not all of us are contented of what we have; but we didn't know that this object was given to us not for its worth for you but a sign / blessing in disguise. Things that appear to us in this world are preparations for what god has in store for us in heaven. Such examples like the Bible abbreviated as Basic Information before Leaving Earth.  Adore everything that god has given to you! What life has given to you whether hellish or heavenish we have to accept it. We will not last long in this earth. We might as well adore what we have in our possessions till our life's end. St. Benilde is so faithful to the Lord that whatever happens to him or what he does is dedicated to God.
