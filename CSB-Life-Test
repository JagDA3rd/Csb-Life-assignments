Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?
	Yes! I have failed many exams because of the lack of sleep, fully-booked school work, & a lot of distractions.
How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what have you done differently? What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?
	My first experience of the CSB Midterm Exams were alright but it was kinda' difficult! Some of the questions give me mental block or a feeling of migraine at a certain period of time. I wish that these questions in the finals wont give me a lot of head aches (I Hope :D ). As of now I have only improved my studying skills, lessened grogeness, & taken most of my distractions away.
