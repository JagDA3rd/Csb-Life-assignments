How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what have you done differently? 
What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?

	Well, it was no different except for an increase in pressure to pass the test. I studied a little more than I
	usually do but still need more time and exert more motivation to study. Maybe I will give more time open for
	studying since this is my future and hoping that it will be.
