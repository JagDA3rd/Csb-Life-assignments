	Reaction Paper for the FROSH ORIENTATION

	I was kind of curious on how the orientation will be handled by big-city people and well, surprisingly there were
	no such differences because where we come from we don't listen much and were noisy, not much has changed from 
	province to city.  And well the topics they have and were given were a repeat of the one in March I attended so
	I already know what they were saying in the first place so that is why I joined the noise and mingled with friends
	but at least I still listened in some parts and talked as quiet as possible.
