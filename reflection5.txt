	Reaction Paper for the FROSH ORIENTATION

On the frosh orientation I thought they were going to discuss about the new or upcoming challenges about being an IT w/ GDD. However, they instead made the orientation more of a get together. It was exciting though.  I was too intrigued by the people there. All of us were very noisy and loud. I thought we were going into separate rooms to know each other better but instead we stayed at the augosto-rosario theatre. I was laughing inside by seeing some of my new block mates having some weird actions or whatever you call it. I don’t know what they are talking about or know their topic. Some were not able to attend. Some were late on arrival but then was redirected to our section. The only two people who are noisy in the orientation were Carlson Aguilar (Ton/Chicks) and Ron Carriaga (KT/BT). During their fascinating conversation there was a time where Ton bangs his head on the wall by accident. Those happenings made me laugh inside. They were very hyper so it kept GD1T “alive” so it made me realize. GD1T is an awesome block for me. Well I wish to get to know a lot more of the MC’s in the orientations. I wasn’t able to attend the first parts orientation but then some was explained to me at the end (last minute entry / attended the 2nd orientation). Having new block mates makes every part of my Benildean Life exquisite and makes me yearn for more.(Making Paul more interested in knowing the whole block)
