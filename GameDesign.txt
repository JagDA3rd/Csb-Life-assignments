Topic: What is the purpose of having lives?

HOW CAN SOMEONE HAVE FUN IF YOU DONT DIE IN A GAME? Putting Lives in a game makes a person struggle to survive in those "harsh" conditions in the game
Other than the arcade fun/profitability of limited life or lives/limiting play factor, quite simply lives add tension to the player. For example if
falling in a hole of a super mario game doesn't do anything... Basically there's no punishment for failing to jump over the hole. But if you fall
and die and you cant surpass the challenge you will lose making the game more interesting/motivating. After passing the challenge the player
feels elightened with experience on how to pass the game. The Harder the games are the more interesting the gameplay is for the player to analyze
how to beat the game. Take note that if the game gets too hard for the player to accomplish then the game gets annoying for the player. So each time 
a player succeeds... he/she gets to brag(if he wants to) to others.
