Grok is a fairly common word amongst geeks and techies, and usage is especially dense within the Computer Science 
university crowd, but it hasn’t really permeated mainstream usage.

Robert A. Heinlein coined the word ‘grok’ in the 1961 Hugo award-winning novel, Stranger in a Strange Land. The novel 
was an international bestseller advocating a free love lifestyle while disparaging authority and organized religion.
