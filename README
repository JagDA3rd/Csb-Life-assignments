What are your new routines?
Getting started in college, I should start by improving myself in reviewing and studying course subjects and being able to apply it in my life.
Like any other, routines change as the experience grows. It might improve for the better because of the pressure of finishing things before deadline 
or the many topics and exams, etc. but it HAS to improve in one way or another so for me, it is a very troubling experience if I find my routines to
be the reason of the end of me and my future. So being able to become a Lasallian/Benildean student, I should and would be able to do ordinary things
extraordinarilly well.

What are your new Roles?
being able to become responsible as a college student. So now, I could be able to take any kind of role for all I know. So I will wait until I know what 
roles I will need to take, but in the meantime, I'm gonna expect some things to happen.

What are your newe assumptions?
Well, I could assume that it will give me  a lot more than what someone could expect. Things I assume are programs like Maya, 3dsMax will be in use for
our development into becoming a game developer and having to use expensive equipment like the Alienwares.

What are your New Relationships?
Well, it would be that I could be able to befriend nice dudes and dudettes and being able to have a few new connections to add those that can help me in
my future, but as long as I'am having fun being with people that will become friends, all will be well.
