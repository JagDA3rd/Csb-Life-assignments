	What are your new routines?
As a Student of CSB I will do things extraordinary. Said by our professors and other teachers... It's because a benildean isn't judged on whats on the outside. It is what he/she's worth! Joke only :)). Anyway I will be a student that will succeed in his goals in life. A benildean never backs down. New challeges? HAH Arvin shall challenge the challenges :). Is that possible you say? Yes it is! I do these things my way. I shall work hard and challenge the others (friendly challenge). I will also take down anyone who goes in my way or if not i'll go the other way. Routines are like choices... Multiple choices and choose the best option or the lucky option. My path is mine to control and i'll make a unique routine for that.

	What are your new Roles?
For being the second eldest in	my family... I will be a good role model to the youths of my family etc... What other roles can I do right now?... Nothing YET! I still have time to create new roles for me. What can I do? What will happen? Only time can tell me for the roles i need to discover.

	What are your new assumptions?
I assume that I can get screwed when I get older... Maybe... I hope not! Seriously I assume that this year will be interesting making games like super ton, Vitamin Fist, JEJEFIST TOURNAMENT etc... New things to discover like engines, C++, C#, Alice?, and other languages for making games :D.

	What are your New Relationships?
When I was young my eyes got attracted to a light. A light that everyone has seen... This light is the Gaming Light (aka the monitor lights of the computer in games). Everyone has played games, new friends, new teachers, and new bullies? NO WAY! When making relationships I Arvin shall choose the right friends either girl or boys and groups never fraternities those suck :)). I will try my best to learn to love new people, things, objects, stuff etc... Cheers to ALL
