This day has become one of the most memorable days of the South East Asia Gamers, the Dragon Nest SEA open beta
starts on this day. Dragon Nest is maybe one of the best online games which has a large publicity from around the 
world.  Some says the best things in life is free to play, well this has become true since Dragon Nest is a free
to play mmorpg that has no lock-on system and relies on getting combos and unlimited combos to do so with your own
style on using skills, attacks and special attacks. 

On this day is one of the best days I ever had since it gave me a new feel on another style in mmorpg's since I
only played noob online games since this day. I hope this will become a huge success and soon will be accepted to
be a competitor to WOW sort of...... but at least we have Cherry Credits and not Nexon to control the game.
