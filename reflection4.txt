Life After College (I attended but didnt write it in the paper cause it's full)

1. What is your reason in choosing a course in line with Human Resources Management?

	I'm not in Human Resources Management....

2. What industry are you interested in?

	I am intereseted in entering a famous game companies such as namco.

3. What position are you targeting upon graduation?

	I would start small then slowly approach or reach my large goal to be part of the Konami team.

4. What companies appeal to you? Why?

	Konami - because they publish/develop awesome games! For example: I played Yie Ar KungF-u! Which is one of my childhood games that was so fun kicking ass like bruce lee including Track and Field for the NES also. Track and Feild is a famous game which I like cause you can Simulate sports in your own home. It's very challenging and hard to finish.

5. What factors would influence your choice of company and position?

	Hideo Kojima - Most of his life (as he says in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker) is made out of Movies. It's up to us to decide what happens to him for the rest. Not only that Hideo Kojima is a Director... He is also A Game Designer, Producer, and a Writer. Don't forget he is also a good businessman. One day I might become somebody like him to follow under his footsteps and become part of the Konami Team.
