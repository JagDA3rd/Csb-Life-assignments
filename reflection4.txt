	I did not chose Human Resources Management.

3. What position are you targeting upon graduation?

        Maybe joining small gaming team or company as a programmer to get experience

4. What companies appeal to you? Why?

	Atlus because of the deep stories and mysteries and the only JRPGs that IGN likes and also because

5. What factors would influence your choice of company and position?

	Katsuna Hashino(not Hoshino) because he created a kind of JRPG that is different from the Final Fantasy
